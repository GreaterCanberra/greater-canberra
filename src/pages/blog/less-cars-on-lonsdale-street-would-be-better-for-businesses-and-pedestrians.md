However, some retailers in the Braddon United Retailers & Traders [have argued](https://citynews.com.au/2022/braddon-traders-say-loss-of-parking-would-cripple-business/) that removing on street parking would be a 'death blow'. This could not be further from the truth. 

## The evidence on pedestrian streets is strong

Numerous studies have found that removing cars from busy urban streets has large economic benefits, including [increased sales](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026427512100367X) for local businesses, and more [rentable properties](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/17538331111176057/full/html) for local property-owners. 

Surveys of business owners [taken after the fact](https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/preview/915484/UTSG%202016%20-%20Melia%20and%20Shergold.pdf) often show that business opposition to pedestrianisation was misplaced, with sales either increasing or being unaffected the changed transport patterns.
