Canberrans believe in taking care of those without a home. Unfortunately, urgently needed supportive housing for older women in Canberra's inner north is currently being held up by a minority of residents. 

That's why Greater Canberra is calling for all Canberrans to want to work together to show our support for YWCA's YHomes development in Ainslie. Below we've outlined just some of the reasons why we're supporting this project, but if you're keen to find out how you can show your support head to the YWCA website, or come along to our event 7pm this Wednesday 23 March (RSVPs required via [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/support-social-housing-for-women-in-need-tickets-301846489977) or [Facebook](https://fb.me/e/2wt72MuEu)). 

## We need more social housing

It might go without saying, but social housing matters. Clearly, as our city keeps growing and house prices keep rising, Canberra will need more social housing to support those in need. But importantly, as women's advocacy organisations have shown, 

Importantly, Canberrans understand the need for more housing...\[add line about polling etc.].

## The YWCA's development will make a real difference

This proposal is for a supported housing facility of nine quality dwellings for older women and women with children who have experienced family violence. \[will add more reasons]

## There's just one thing this project needs - your support!

Come along to hear a bit about the development, ask some questions, and if you're willing, submit your support for the project. We'll have information about the project on hand, and computers where you can write a letter in support, or use a form letter provided. Let's show our support for a great community project!

For those who can't make it, but would still like to make a representation in support of this project, you can find out more details at [https://ywca-canberra.org.au/.../yhomes-ainslie-development/](https://ywca-canberra.org.au/community-services/housing-support-unit/yhomes-ainslie-development/?fbclid=IwAR3WwWIMs1NyH6RUaUT8NbGO-FpfSihYG_qs4bwGF_uUoHe1VPXxAQxeKOs)
