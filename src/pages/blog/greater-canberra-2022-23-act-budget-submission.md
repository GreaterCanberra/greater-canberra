## Introduction

Greater Canberra was excited at the opportunity to make the following submission to the 2022-23 ACT Budget consultation. 

Greater Canberra is a community organisation working towards a more liveable, sustainable and affordable Canberra. We are particularly concerned with representing the voices of younger Canberrans and renters in debates around urban planning and local housing policy.

While Canberra prides itself on being a community where people of all backgrounds can find economic opportunities, our current exclusionary planning system and high rents mean those opportunities are increasingly out of reach for many Canberrans.

This submission focuses on the economic impacts of Canberra’s current high housing costs, and explores the potential for reforms to Canberra’s planning system to reduce rents and house prices. In addition to reducing housing stress for low income Canberrans, our recommendations would expand Canberra’s attractiveness as a destination for Australian workers, and increase Canberra’s long run productivity and economic growth.

## 1 Key recommendations

* Reducing housing costs should be a key plank of the ACT’s economic growth strategy. 

  * Canberra’s high housing costs relative to other Australian cities have reduced the number of people able to afford to live in the ACT, and are making it difficult for Canberra businesses to attract top talent. 
  * Drawing on analysis of employment, rental, and migration data, we find that for every $1 increase in ACT per week rents above the Australian capital city average, around 18 fewer Australians are able to move to the ACT each year.
* The ACT’s planning system should be reformed to prioritise increased affordability. 

  * A range of economic literature shows that removing unnecessary barriers to mid-density homes in urban areas can significantly reduce rents and prices.
  * Expanding ‘Mr Fluffy’ rules to all RZ1 land would make dual-occupancy homes easier to build on around 60,000 additional ACT properties.
  * Adopting ‘New Zealand style’ zoning reforms in inner urban areas could unlock 30,000 to 50,000 new homes near jobs, transit, and amenities. 
* Reforms to the ACT planning system should be informed by Canberra’s broader economic development goals.

  * The ACT Government should directly model housing affordability as part of its ongoing housing supply and land release planning.
  * Housing affordability and adequate housing supply should be included as explicit objectives in the next ACT Planning Act.
* The ACT Government’s Housing Strategy should be revised to increase the Strategy’s ambition with regard to the provision of social housing.

  * Consistent with the recommendations of other ACT community organisations including ACTCOSS, the ACT Government should urgently bring forward additional investment in social and affordable housing.
  * Any update to the Housing Strategy should review elements of the current ACT planning system that are blocking new social and community housing projects. 

## 2 **Impact of high rents on the ACT economy**

Housing costs represent a large component of household expenditure across Australia, and are an important contributor to financial stress, in particular among low income households. 

While much of the media coverage of the housing market focuses on the impact of high house prices, our analysis here largely focuses on the negative impact of high rents. Trends in rents are particularly important to the ACT economy because rates of renting in the ACT tend to be slightly above the national average, and housing costs make up a higher proportion of household expenditure for renters, as compared to homeowners.

Our research indicates that recent increases in ACT rents have had a marked impact on the cost of living in Canberra as compared to other Australian capital cities, which has increased financial stress among Canberrans, and significantly reduced ACT interstate migration.

### 2.1 Trends in ACT rents

Over the five years to March 2022, Canberra rents increased steadily at an average annual rate of around 2.8%, compared to annual CPI growth of around 2.6%. This has resulted in Canberra rents increasing by a total of 15% over the past five years, compared with an increase of just 3% in Sydney and a decrease of 2% in Melbourne (see Chart 1).

Data: ABS, [Consumer Price Index](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/consumer-price-index-australia/latest-release), March 2022.

Data on asking rents - which are often a leading indicator of trends in the broader ABS rents index - suggest an even larger differential between rents in Canberra and other capital cities. CoreLogic data as of the March quarter 2022, indicates ACT median rents were the highest of any capital city at $674 per week, compared with $621 per week in Sydney and $468 per week in Melbourne. In addition, Canberra asking rents grew at 3.3% in the March quarter, the fastest growth of any capital city.

In summary, these data strongly suggest that the ACT is facing an ongoing shortage of rental accommodation. This is supported by data on residential vacancy rates, which indicates that Canberra’s residential vacancy rates have been persistently lower than 2% since 2015.
