The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) [recent report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-3/) on climate mitigation makes for sobering reading.

Under current policy settings, the world is on track for global heating of 3.2 °C by 2100 - with hugely damaging consequences for both humans and ecosystems. If we as Canberrans are serious about doing our bit for the climate, we need to make deep and lasting cuts to our emissions.

Nonetheless, there are some positives. Importantly, the latest report provides an array of evidence of the power of local policymakers to make deep cuts to emissions by making our more compact, efficient, and sustainable. 

As ACT policymakers consider reforms to the ACT's planning legislation this year, here's three findings from the latest report they should consider.

## 1. Urbanisation is an opportunity, not a threat

Many people see dense cities, along with their cars, footpaths, and apartment buildings as anathema to climate action. However, the latest IPCC report makes clear, while emissions from cities are increasing, continued urbanisation still represents an important opportunity to decrease emissions:

> *The growing concentration of people and activities is an opportunity to increase resource efficiency and decarbonize at scale...For most regions, per capita urban emissions are lower than per capita national emissions.* (Chapter 8 Executive Summary)

Far from being a risk to the climate, urban growth can advance climate action by attracting new investment in low-carbon infrastructure, and enabling communities to reduce their combined carbon emissions. As the IPCC finds:

> *For the same level of consumption and basic services, an average urban dweller often requires less energy than their rural counterparts, due to higher population densities that enable sharing of infrastructure and services.* (Chapter 8 Box 8.1)

Unfortunately, the fact that urban density can decrease carbon emissions is still yet to sink in among much of the public. ACT policymakers need to be clear about the state of the research, and bring the public along with them by highlighting the key role sustainable urbanisation can play in climate action.
